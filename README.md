# Periodic Voronoi

This simulates a voronoi diagram with periodic boundary conditions. In a voronoi diagram, the polygons on the boundaries are undefined. Adding periodic boundary conditions assures that every polygon in the voronoi diagram is well defined. 





# Voronoi Diagram

A voronoi diagram partitions N points into convex polygons such that each polygon contains one point and the point is closer to its generating point than any other point. The delaunay triangulation is the dual to a voronoi diagram. The delaunay triangulation of a set of points is the triangulation that does not allow a point to be inside the circumcircle surrounding the triangle. This maximizes the minimum angle for every triangle in the triangulation. The voronoi diagram can be constructed from the delaunay triangulation by finding the perpendicular bisectors for every edge in the triangulation.

# Periodic Bounday Conditions 

Periodic boundary conditions assume that when you reach the maximum length of a box, you wrap back around to 0.
